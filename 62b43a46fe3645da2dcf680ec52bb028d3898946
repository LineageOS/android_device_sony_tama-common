If you want I can upload the changes and you can test them. Or you can do that and re-upload and abandoning these.\n\nAlso, we use \"tama-common\" as prefix now and after a colon the first letter should be uppercase.\n\nLet me know if you want to do that (cause I don\u0027t want to ignore your contribution; so pls don\u0027t get me wrong) or if I can upload the changes.\n\nOh and for the future you can assign the changes to me.",

There are lots of conflicts, and I ended up just rewriting them. Can you identify which of luks\u0027 patches you are using?\n\nI\u0027ve fixed the subject lines in v3, but I recognize that may be moot.\n\nColin",

I\u0027m always using the `-n` flag with cherry-picking so no commit is done and I\u0027m able to change the commit message properly. Also I\u0027ve setup meld as my merge tool so I can easily resolve conflicts with `git mergetool`.\n\nI would prefer to abandon these changes because keeping the original author (which is luk) is a better aproach. I really appreciate your contributions. If you want to upload with picked changes from luk feel free. Or if you want I can upload them myself on sunday evening (CEST).",

To obtain sony-modem-switcher from SODP binaries instead of stock ROMs. I haven\u0027t been able to find it on stock. It\u0027s not in vendor, and my extraction tools aren\u0027t working for system. Perhaps you\u0027ll have more luck there. I\u0027ve also switched to homegrown rc files as, again, they\u0027re not in my ROMs.\n\n2. sepolicy. The sepolicy for tama-common is completely different from gangesâ€¦ and not at all merge-compatible with it. It needs a lot of tweaking to make it work.\n\nThe rest is just configuration, individually cherry-picked.\n\nI won\u0027t be offended if you want to re-work this, particularly if you can source the proprietary files from wherever you usually get them.
