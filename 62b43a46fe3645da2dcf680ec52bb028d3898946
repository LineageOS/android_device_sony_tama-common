      "message": "Hello,\n\nit\u0027s better to pick the changes made by luk directly so the original author isn\u0027t lost. I\u0027ve done that already locally. If you want I can upload the changes and you can test them. Or you can do that and re-upload and abandoning these.\n\nAlso, we use \"tama-common\" as prefix now and after a colon the first letter should be uppercase.\n\nLet me know if you want to do that (cause I don\u0027t want to ignore your contribution; so pls don\u0027t get me wrong) or if I can upload the changes.\n\nOh and for the future you can assign the changes to me.",

There are lots of conflicts, and I ended up just rewriting them. Can you identify which of luks\u0027 patches you are using?\n\nI\u0027ve fixed the subject lines in v3, but I recognize that may be moot.\n\nColin",

I\u0027m always using the `-n` flag with cherry-picking so no commit is done and I\u0027m able to change the commit message properly. Also I\u0027ve setup meld as my merge tool so I can easily resolve conflicts with `git mergetool`.\n\nI would prefer to abandon these changes because keeping the original author (which is luk) is a better aproach. I really appreciate your contributions. If you want to upload with picked changes from luk feel free. Or if you want I can upload them myself on sunday evening (CEST).",
